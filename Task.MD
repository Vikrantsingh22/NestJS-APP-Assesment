Assignment: Building Basic CRUD Operations for PostgreSQL Database with NESTjs

### Objective:

Develop a basic NESTjs application to manage a PostgreSQL database with two tables: Users and WalletAddress. Implement CRUD operations for these tables.

### Tables:

1. Users

- Define the attributes for the Users table.

2. WalletAddress

- Define the attributes for the WalletAddress table.

### Requirements:

1. API Endpoints:

- Implement basic CRUD operations for both Users and WalletAddress tables.

2. Validation:

- Implement basic validation for input data to ensure data integrity.

3. Error Handling:

- Handle basic errors and provide appropriate responses.

4. Documentation:

- Provide basic documentation for the API endpoints and any setup instructions.

### Instructions:

1. Database Setup:

- Set up a PostgreSQL database with two tables: Users and WalletAddress. Define appropriate attributes for each table.

2. NESTjs Application:

- Develop a NESTjs application to handle CRUD operations for the Users and WalletAddress tables.

3. API Development:

- Implement simple API endpoints for CRUD operations on both tables.

4. Testing:

- Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl to ensure basic functionality.

5. Code Quality:

- Write simple, well-commented code following basic NESTjs conventions.

6. Submission:

- Submit the code along with basic documentation and any necessary setup instructions.

### Note:

- Time Limit: Aim to complete the assignment within an hour or two.
- Codebase Access: Do not include any proprietary code or sensitive information in your submission.
- Third-party Libraries: You may use simple libraries like pg for database interactions.
- Security: Basic security measures like hashing passwords are recommended but not mandatory for this assignment.
